# DMD-GUI
A GUI for you to use DMD more comfortably, it even makes sounds to tell if the compiling was successful or not. It is 100% written in D and uses only the arsd library.

In order to use the DMD GUI you just need to download the executable file into your project's folder, type the name of your source code file, select the boxes and click on Compile. Then press Enter to run the program you've just created.

If you wanna get the source code of the DMD GUI and compile it yourself in order to create the DMD GUI on your computer then download the source code along with the 'dependencies' file, extract it and type in the terminal the command: dmd source -m64 -i -J. -O -g
