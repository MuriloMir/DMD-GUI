# DMD-GUI
A GUI for you to use DMD more comfortably. It is 100% written in D and uses only the arsd library.

Just download the DMD GUI executable file (check if it's the Linux or the Windows version) into your project's folder, type the name of your source code file and then select the boxes and click on Compile. Then presse Enter to run the program.

It makes sounds to tell if the compiling was successful or not.

If you wanna compile it yourself, download the DMD GUI All Files and type in the terminal the command: dmd source -i -m64 -J. -O (notice there is a dot after J).
